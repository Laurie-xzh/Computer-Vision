# Computer-Vision
all of the experiments are done in jupyer notebook, run the code block in every .ipynb blocks one by one to train and test the models.
## Basic Network
Below is the structure of three different blocks in ResNet, GoogLeNet and ResNeXt.

In this experiment, VGG, ResNet, GoogLeNet and ResNeXt are implemented with PyTorch and train/test on CIFAR-10.
|Model | Accuracy | Parameters | 
| :---- | ----: | :----: | 
VGG11 | 0.766 | 28M 
VGG16| 0.790 | 33M
ResNet18 | 0.892  | 11M
GoogLeNet | 0.759 | 6M 
ResNeXt | 0.913 | 34M
